## ðŸ“„ Project Description

We designed and implemented a combinational logic circuit using Verilog HDL.  
The circuit accepts four binary inputs: `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`, and generates two outputs: `Y1` and `Y2`.

### ðŸ”§ Output Logic
- **Y1 = 1** when the **majority (3 or more)** of the inputs are high.  
- **Y2 = 1** only when **all inputs are identical** (i.e., all 0s or all 1s).  
- Otherwise, both outputs behave accordingly based on the input pattern.

### ðŸ’» Tools & Hardware
- Verilog HDL  
- Xilinx Vivado / Intel Quartus  
- FPGA Development Board (as provided in the lab)

### ðŸ§ª Outcome
The logic was simulated and synthesized using the FPGA board, demonstrating a solid understanding of:
- Digital logic design  
- Verilog coding practices  
- FPGA-based hardware implementation
