we designed and implemented a combinational logic circuit using Verilog HDL. The circuit accepts four binary inputs (A, B, C, and D) and generates two outputs:

Y1 is high (1) when the majority (3 or more) of the inputs are high.

Y2 is high (1) only when all inputs are identical (all 0s or all 1s).

The logic was simulated and synthesized using an FPGA development board, demonstrating practical understanding of digital design, Verilog coding, and hardware implementation.
